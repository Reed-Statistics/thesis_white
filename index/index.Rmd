# If you are creating a PDF you'll need to write your preliminary content 
# (e.g., abstract, acknowledgements) below or use code similar to line 25-26 
# for the .RMD files. If you are NOT producing a PDF, delete or silence
# lines 25-39 in this YAML header.
abstract: '`r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) paste(readLines(here::here("prelims", "00-abstract.Rmd")), collapse = "\n  ")`'
# If you'd rather include the preliminary content in files instead of inline
# like below, use a command like that for the abstract above.  Note that a tab 
# is needed on the line after the `|`.
acknowledgements: |
  This is where acknowledgements will go. 
dedication: |
  To my family. 
preface: |
  This is an example of a thesis setup to use the reed thesis document class 
  (for LaTeX) and the R bookdown package, in general.

<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of 
metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete the section entirely, or silence them (add # before each line). 

If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, make sure to delete the index.Rmd file and then knit again.

<!--
The ackowledgements, preface, dedication, and abstract are added into the PDF
version automatically by inputing them in the YAML at the top of this file.
Alternatively, you can put that content in files like 00--prelim.Rmd and
00-abstract.Rmd like done below.
-->



```{r eval=!knitr::is_latex_output(), child=here::here("prelims", "00--prelim.Rmd")}

```

```{r eval=!knitr::is_latex_output(), child=here::here("prelims", "00-abstract.Rmd")}

```

<!-- The {.unnumbered} option here means that the introduction will be 
"Chapter 0." You can also use {-} for no numbers on chapters.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This is the introduction to my thesis.
