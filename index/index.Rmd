# If you are creating a PDF you'll need to write your preliminary content 
# (e.g., abstract, acknowledgements) below or use code similar to line 25-26 
# for the .RMD files. If you are NOT producing a PDF, delete or silence
# lines 25-39 in this YAML header.

# If you'd rather include the preliminary content in files instead of inline

  This is an example of a thesis setup to use the reed thesis document class 
  (for LaTeX) and the R bookdown package, in general.

<!-- # Introduction {.unnumbered} -->

<!-- This thesis aims to introduce novel ways to estimate forest attributes.  -->

<!-- * Chapter \@ref(context) introduces the problem at hand, our research question, and discusses current common approaches for estimation of forest attributions. We also introduce less common approaches to performing this estimation, such as the hierarchical Bayesian approach. We introduce the idea of borrowing strength and discuss how different estimators borrow strength. -->
