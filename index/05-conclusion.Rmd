# Discussion

We have introduced, fit, and presented the results of six small area estimators across the Interior West with four forestry-related response variables. Particularly, we introduce two estimators which are uncommon in forestry research: the hierarchical Bayesian unit- and area-level estimators. The area-level hierarchical Bayesian estimator reduces variance in estimates significantly compared to common direct estimators, frequentist model-based approaches (EBLUPs), and the unit-level hierarchical Bayesian estimator. We see reduction in variance compared to the area-level frequentist estimator and post-stratification in the great majority of small areas when implementing the hierarchical Bayesian area-level estimator. In extremely non-forested small areas, the hierarchical Bayesian area-level estimator consistently has higher variance than post-stratification or the area-level EBLUP. This is likely due to the way in which the area-level hierarchical Bayesian estimator borrows strength. 

## Possible Extensions

Now we turn to possible extensions to the work which has been done in this thesis. We explore ideas for further research on adjacent topics and possibilities for applying these methods in other locations. 

First, attempting to understand the performance of these hierarchical Bayesian estimators outside of the Interior West region of the United States through implementing these methods across the country would be insightful to the generalization of these estimators. Outside of the Interior West, the Forest Inventory and Analysis Programs has research stations in the Pacific Northwest region, Northern region, and Southern region. The hierarchical Bayesian area-level estimator is also a great candidate for estimation in Alaska. The reasons for its great candidacy are twofold: first, it is expensive and difficult to send foresters to collect data in Alaska due to the extreme rurality of the area; second, Alaska is very forested and we thus would likely see a large reduction in variance of estimates when using the hierarchical Bayesian area-level estimator. 

- some sort of hybrid estimator: rely on eblup area when it does well (desert), and bayes otherwise (talk about how bayes performance was very non-random)    
- explicit spatial analysis     
- simulation study to understand the bias of these estimators     
- different regions of the united states: list all FIA regions     
- improved software for bayesian sae, more flexible software, non-normal response? (gamma or tweedie)     
- different aux data, desert/non-desert could be helpful
