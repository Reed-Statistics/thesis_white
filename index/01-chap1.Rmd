It is of interest of government organizations such as the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) to be able to have reliable estimates of forest attributes in small domains such as ecological subsections (often refered to as ecosubsections) or counties. In particular, the FIA would like to have estimates with low variance in ecological subsections, however, the FIA only samples a small numbers of plots in these small areas. The research goal of this thesis is to address this problem by using techniques which seek to minimize variance of estimates while only introducing a small amount of bias. Having precise estimates of forest attributes at the ecosection level is crucial for educational programs and implementation of programs which seek to maintain the health of our forests. 

There are are wide range of techniques that can be used to address the problem of estimation of forest attributes. Broadly, these methods fall into three categories: direct estimators, indirect estimators, and model-based estimators. These are all methods of small area estimation. Direct estimators are those that rely only on the samples within the small area which we would like to measure. Some examples of a direct estimator are the mean of a variable, or the post-stratified estimate of a variable. These estimates do not rely on information outside of the small area being estimated, nor any auxilary information or data to produce their estimates. The second kind of estimator, indirect estimators, rely on data outside of the area of interest to produce their estimate, however they do not rely on auxilary data. With indirect estimators, we can use information (or "borrow strength") from nearby small areas to help improve our estimate in our area of interest. Finally, model-based estimators are those which both borrow strength from other small areas and use auxilary information to compute the estimate of interest. Within the category of model-based estimators, there are two classes, unit-level and area-level models. Unit-level models consider information at the level of which the data was collected. Area-level models consider information that has been aggregated to the level of a small area before the model is fit to the data. 

A small area estimation technique that has been increasing in popularity in the realm of applications to the FIA and forestry data in general is model-based estimation. As the FIA requires less variance in their estimates of increasingly smaller areas, it becomes inevitable that borrowing strength from surrounding areas and the use of auxilary data is needed to maintain a satisfactory amount of precision. To implement these models, there are two statistical schools of thought: frequentist methods and Bayesian methods. Frequentist models are the most common for estimation of forest attributes in small area estimation [CITE LOTS OF PAPERS HERE]. These are models which are often fit by maximum likelihood estimation and other methods of maximizing the likelihood function such are restricted maximum likelihood estimation. The likelihood can be written as
$$
P(X ~\vert ~ \theta)
$$
where $X$ is the data and $\theta$ is the parameter of interest. Note that the likelihood function allows the value of $X$ to vary while the parameter, $\theta$, is considered a fixed value. The other school of statistical thought, Bayesian statistics, considers the parameter of interest as varying while the considering the data as fixed. We call this the posterior distribution of $\theta$, and Bayes' theorem gives us the following relation
$$
P(\theta ~\vert ~ X) = \frac{P(X ~\vert ~ \theta) P(\theta)}{P(X)}
$$
