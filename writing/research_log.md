Fall, Week 1
----------------

### This Week's Work

This week, I have been reviewing relevant literature on both Hierarchical Bayesian modeling and forestry research, along with familiarizing myself with the data. I wrote summaries of the papers I read in the literature review document. I also read through a good portion of the selected chapters of Monika's book. 

I was able to source a few more papers, and one that seemed extremely relevant was a draft version of Finley's LiDAR paper. This paper gave some great background on forestry data and SAE along with nice reporting of results. They did a simulation study to understand how well their (FH and FHCAR) models performed. 

I also breifly looked into the `hbsae` package. The `fSAE.Unit()` function seems to be the main function and it looks very well set up with nice documentation and great explanations for what each argument of the function does and what dimensions that object should have. Other than that, I didn't look much further into the package. 

I also looked into the data, but I think I would benefit from walking through it at some point. I will definitely spend more time on that front soon as well, I think it's going to take awhile to get a good sense of the data. 

### Upcoming Work

* Read, source, and summarize more relevant papers

* Figure out best software to do the analysis (eventually, might not be pressing now?)
    * STAN, JAGS, `rstan` in `tidymodels`, `hbsae`, etc.
        * `hbsae` seems quite promising from an inital look
        
* Dig deeper into the data

* Learn about more HB modeling techniques outside of the FH family

### Points of confusion

* Can I post scripts that use the data on github or does that uses/visualizes the data in any way need to stay local on my computer?

* I am trying to better understand the data and it is going to be used in the models. I think I would really benefit from getting a bit more of a concrete understanding of the process.
    * In my mind, the large overview of the project looks like: 1) gain significant domain knowledge and a fuller understanding of HB modeling. 2) Implement models on multiple small areas. 3) Compare model performance across models I specified and frequentist models in existing literature by looking at things like MSE, bias, etc. 4) Understand benefits and costs of using the HB framework for trying to answer SAE questions. Does this seem reasonable? Are there significant missing steps/analyses that are needed? 
        * This stepwise plan seems to fit really well with the Finley (2017) draft paper and what they did there. 

* Outside of making sure I have the scope and goals of the thesis in my mind correctly and the steps I feel should be taken are somewhat accurate, I also feel that there is a *lot* for me to learn about forestry variables and the data itself.

## Research Log


You will use this document to keep track of where you are in the project and where you are going. Each week, complete the following:

- Summarize what you learned and worked.
    + Don't forget to push all update to your GitHub repository.
    + Update the Notes/Issues in your GitHub Project.
- Summarize and prioritize the next things that need to be done.
    + Create informative "To Dos" in your GitHub repository.
- Identify any (big/small/technical/conceptual/anything) ideas that are fuzzy/confusing/baffling.
