- Summarize what you learned and worked.
    + Don't forget to push all update to your GitHub repository.
    + Update the Notes/Issues in your GitHub Project.
- Summarize and prioritize the next things that need to be done.
    + Create informative "To Dos" in your GitHub repository.
- Identify any (big/small/technical/conceptual/anything) ideas that are fuzzy/confusing/baffling.
