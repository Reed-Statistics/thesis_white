Fall, Week 1
----------------

### This Week's Work

This week, I have been reviewing relevant literature on both Hierarchical Bayesian modeling and forestry research, along with familiarizing myself with the data. I wrote summaries of the papers I read in the literature review document. I also read through a good portion of the selected chapters of Monika's book. 

### Upcoming Work

* Read and source more relevant papers

* Figure out best software to do the analysis (eventually, might not be pressing now?)
    * STAN, JAGS, `rstan` in `tidymodels`, etc.

### Points of confusion

* Can I post scripts that use the data on github or does that uses/visualizes the data in any way need to stay local on my computer?

* I am trying to better understand the data and it is going to be used in our model(s). This, along with the stepwise process of the project seem unclear to me. I think I would really benefit from getting a bit more of a concrete understanding there.
    * In my mind, the large overview of the project looks like: 1) gain significant domain knowledge and a fuller understanding of HB modeling. 2) Implement model(s) on multiple small areas. 3) Compare model performance across models I specified and frequentist models in existing literature by looking at things like MSE, bias, etc. 4) Understand benefits and costs of using the HB framework for trying to answer SAE questions. Does this seem reasonable? Are there significant missing steps/analyses that are needed? 

* Outside of making sure I have the scope and goals of the thesis in my mind correctly and the steps I feel should be taken are somewhat accurate, I also feel that there is a *lot* for me to learn about forestry variables and the data itself.

## Research Log


You will use this document to keep track of where you are in the project and where you are going. Each week, complete the following:

- Summarize what you learned and worked.
    + Don't forget to push all update to your GitHub repository.
    + Update the Notes/Issues in your GitHub Project.
- Summarize and prioritize the next things that need to be done.
    + Create informative "To Dos" in your GitHub repository.
- Identify any (big/small/technical/conceptual/anything) ideas that are fuzzy/confusing/baffling.
