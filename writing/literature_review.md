### Ver Plank et al (2017): Hierarchical Bayesian models for small area estimation of forest variables using LiDAR

This paper proposes three Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) models for small area estimation (SAE) of above ground biomass (AGB). These models are the Fay-Herriot (FH), Fay-Herriot with conditional autoregressive random effects (FHCAR), and FHCAR with smoothed sampling variance. They first introduce the FH model with is defined as: 
$$
Y_i = \theta_i + \epsilon_i \\
\theta_i = x_i \beta + v_i
$$
