Context:

<!-- The remainder of the content within this thesis is organized as follows:  -->



<!-- The amount of information used from outside areas is decided by the posterior density of ratio of the between-area variance and the within-area variance. -->

<!-- *provides background material on the topic and other approaches, and identifies what is added by this thesis* -->
<!-- To implement these models, there are two statistical schools of thought: frequentist methods and Bayesian methods. Frequentist models are the most common for estimation of forest attributes in small area estimation [CITE LOTS OF PAPERS HERE]. However, Bayesian methods have been used at the area-level for small area estunation of of forest attributes [@ver2017]. While frequentist methods are often viewed as the "default" method for doing small area estimation, there are many benefits of tackling these problems from a Bayesian perspective. Notably, Bayesian estimation utilizes prior distributions which allow us to quantify our prior uncertainty about the values of each parameter.  -->
